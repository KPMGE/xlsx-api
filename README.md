# xlsx-api :page_facing_up:
This is a simple express api that given a query saves it to a xlsx file and
returns through an http response.

## How do i run it? :running:
In order to run this project, first install all the dependencies: 

```bash
yarn install
```

after that, you should be good to go, you can start the api now by running: 

```bash
yarn start
```

Now you can either make an http request to the endpoint: [http://localhost:<port>/download-xlsx](http://localhost:<port>/download-xlsx)
or open up the _page.html_ file on your browser instead
